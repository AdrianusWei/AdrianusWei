👋 Hi, I’m @AdrianusWei, currently a junior at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ).

🔭 I’m interested in truly exciting topics, such as AGI and AI Scientists. 

🔧 My current focus: 

- Pushing the frontiers of LLM intelligence through efficient yet scalable methods such as reinforcement learning (RL). 

- Scaling agent intelligence beyond fixed base models using self-referential iteration and evolutionary algorithms.
